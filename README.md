 1. Cutlets use case:
F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

2.LAB TAT use case :
A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a     random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch.
Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

3. buyers ratio use case :
Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.

4.fatloons use case :
Fantaloons Sales managers commented that % of males versus females walking in to the store differ based on day of the week. Analyze the data and determine whether there is evidence at 5 % significance level to support this hypothesis.
